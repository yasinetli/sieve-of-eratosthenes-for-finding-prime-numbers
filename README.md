# sieve-of-eratosthenes-for-finding-prime-numbers
A script that lists prime numbers up to a certain number using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
Eratosthenes is a famous ancient Greek polymath. His proposed algorithm for finding prime numbers is known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes. In this algorithm, numbers up to a certain limit are sorted as a list. Afterwards, starting from 2, numbers are marked as prime numbers without any processing. In addition, multiples of this number are excluded from the list. In this way, time is saved. Here, this algorithm is expressed as a Python script.
